This is a simple wordle game.

In this project, we are creating a simple game of wordle where we generate a random five letter word from a dataset and the user is supposed to guess the word

This project uses a very simple and straight forward approach.

You get six a total of 6 chances to correctly guess the word.

If the word you guessed has an alphabet represented with the green colour, it means that you have guessed the correct alphabet and it is present at the correct location. If it is represented with yellow colour, it means that the alphabet exists but it is present at the wrong location.

Have fun!
